		<h2>My life</h2>
			<p>My name is Mayoori Giritharan and I am 14 years old. I have my two wonderful parents. Their names are Dharmarajan(Dad) and Shivanjali(Mom).<br>
			I also have a younger sister (Harshini)&hearts;, who is a 13 year old in middle school. I was born in Scarborough and have lived there all my life.<br>
			I love listening to music,which is why I currently do not have a favorite song.I also love swimming and tennis. Fun fact, I've swam in the lane right<br>
			next to Penny Olesiak during swim practice! I also know how to crochet and I love going out on walks! As for the schools I have previously attended,<br>
