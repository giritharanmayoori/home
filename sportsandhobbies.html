		<h2>Sports</h2>
		<p>
			As you may have found out from the fun facts page, I indeed do competitive swimming. I have been swimming for as long as I can remember.
			However, just like many others I also used to have a fear of the deep end. I took sometime, for me to get over my fear of swimming in the deep
			end, but I did it because I knew I really enjoyed the nature of competitve swimming.

		<p> For the past 3-4 years, I have been swimming for Scarborough Swim Club. One of the many amazing bonuses that come with swimming with Scarborough
			swim club, includes the fact that I get to train at the Toronto Pan Am Sports Center (TPASC), where even professional/olympic swimmers like
			Penny Oleksiak, Michele Toro, Finlay Knox, Taylor Ruck, and others train.

		<h2>Hobbies</h2>
		<p> Not only do I do competitve swimming, but I also love to read and crochet.<br>
			I mostly prefer fiction/fantasy over anything else, but I also love to read<br>
			books that are based upon true experiences. Some of the books I really enjoyed<br>
			include:
			<ul>
				<li>Color Me In by Natasha Diaz</li>              
				<li>Nancy Drew by Carolyn Keene</li>
				<li>The Hate U GIve by Angie Thomas</li>
				<li>The light beteween Worlds by Laura E. Weymouth</li>  
				<li> and more!</li>
			</ul>
